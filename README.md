# whois-scraper
Python module for scraping WHOIS information from http://www.whois.com/whois/

## Note

This was made for an one-off small freelancing project, around the March of 2016. That was a loong time ago, there's no reason I'd continue development on this, so I'll be archiving this repo. You're welcome to use this, or fork it if you like. Shoot me an email for anything else.
